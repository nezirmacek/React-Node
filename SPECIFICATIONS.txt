web (https://github.com/natashache/SoundwiseCMS_mobile):
    1. soundcast:
        - Each series in the library will need to be updated as the group administrator upload new episodes from the
        web interface.
    2. dashboard (admin only):
        - add the menu
        - an audio recorder on the dashboard
        - save audios, images, and notes to AWS, get the url back and store the urls in the database
        - administrator needs to send announcement as messages to user’s phone
        - administrator needs to be able to see which user has listened to which episodes
        - administrator needs to be able to add new listeners  to each series (send invitations)
        -  An email invitation needs to be sent to listener (tell them to download the app) once they’re added, if they
        don’t already have a Soundwise account.
        - for file name use a uid generator (file name is the same as episode uid)
        - We also need unique IDs for each soundcast, publisher, etc
        - need a date/time property for each episode (date_created)
    3. invites:
        - The invites function: once the administrator creates a soundcast, he has to let his people know that it’s now
        available. after he enters the email addresses of the group, we need to check if these emails are already
        associated with Soundwise account. Sind people can only create subscriber accounts on the mobile app, if we
        don’t find an account associated with the email in the system, that means this user has not downloaded the
        mobile app. so we need to send an email to the user and ask them to download the app, so that they can join
        the group.  And if we find that an email already has an account in the database, that means the person already
        has the mobile app. In that case we do not send the email, but simply add the new soundest to this user’s
        library, so that the person starts receiving the new soundcast without having to do anything.
        - So the process has several steps: 
            1. administrator creates a new soundcast and enters email addresses of his group of listeners
              2. we check, one by one, if each email address is already associated with a soundwise account  
            3. if yes (that means the listener has already downloaded the app before), add the new soundcast to the
            account’s library. And the listener should receive mobile notification that a new soundcast is added.
              4. if no(that means the person has not downloaded the app), we send an email to ask the person to download
            the app. Once he downloads it and creates an account, we automatically add the new soundcast to his library
        - so when we get a user email address from a group administrator, and we cannot find an account associated with
        that email, it could be either
            1) the user doesn’t have the app installed, or
            2) user installed app and registered with a different email address.
          In either case, we send an email to the unregistered email address, asking the user “do you have the app
        installed? if not, please install it following this link and sign up with this email address. if you already
        have the app, please open the app and add this new email address to your account".
    4. publisher registration:
        - The first admin of an organization will need to create a user account for herself,
        - create a publisher for the organization,
        - and then she has the right to make others admins of the publisher.
mobile:
    0. common:
        - start a new react native project called “SoundwiseCMS_mobile”, copy and paste the useful code from the old
        app, and then push it to the new GitHub repo for the mobile app
    1. soundcast:
        - update and download new episodes when app is in the background. When app is in the background, the .on() event
        listener won’t work. we’ll probably need to use the cloud messaging function
        https://github.com/evollu/react-native-fcm and react native background tasks
        https://github.com/jamesisaac/react-native-background-task
        - send push notification to user.
        - users need to get notification for announcement from admin
        - if he has the app installed and he doesn’t see the new soundcast, he can enter the new email in the mobile
        app and we’ll find the new soundcast for him
    2. background player:
        - I had a discussion with the host of react-native-music-control on the bug. I tried their suggested fix. but
        still couldn’t get it to work on real device
        https://github.com/tanguyantoine/react-native-music-control/issues/53#issuecomment-317785558
    3. refactoring:
        - convert/repurpose UI and audio player functionalities into new app, including playing on lock screen
    4. login/signup:
        - in/sign up flow as specified in the mockup
api:
    1. statistics:
        - the database will need to store data for each listening session with time stamp.
        - the data need to be easily retrieved to calculate different statistics
        - it should include date and time (unix timestamp)
    2. soundcast:
        - we should make accessing audio files secure. i.e. front end needs to make a request to backend for an access
        key to AWS before making request to AWS
    3.  DB:
        - let's set up DB locally first. Let's use Postgres
firebase:
    0. common:
        - added three new nodes in firebase DB: soundcasts, episodes, and comments

        soundcast:  {
            "title": "Example Soundcast",
            "creatorID": "xD5tW78sX6M96C4xpd7iOIN5Qth1",

        }

                "4fionviutrmrem": true
            }
        }

        comment:  {
            "voesfmvioedkht": {
                "userID": "vcarieemgridos",
                "timestamp": 1901756724,

            },
        }
    1. emails node:
        - node in the firebase DB called “emails”, with email as key and userID as content
    2. user node:
        - admin: {
            "firstName": "Denis",
            "lastName": "Yakovenko",
            "admin": true,
            "publisherID": "smoeist9oveshvi",
            "soundcasts_managed": {
                "5a83201c-76bd-11e7-b5a5-be2e44b06b34": true,
                "35546702-76cb-11e7-b5a5-be2e44b06b34": true
            },
            "email": [
                "denis@me.come"
            ],
            "subscriptions": {
                "5a83201c-76bd-11e7-b5a5-be2e44b06b34": true,
                "35546702-76cb-11e7-b5a5-be2e44b06b34": true
            }
        }
        - only the administrators will have “admin”, “publisherID”, “soundcasts_managed” properties
    3. publisher:
        - A publisher can have multiple soundcasts.
        - Each soundcast has a series of episodes.
        - A publisher can have one or more administrators who have access to the publisher account.
        For example, the publisher is Keller Williams Realty company. The administrators are the vice president and the
        secretary, who can upload content and distribute to the group.
